This script helps keeping track of the number of tests in a Perl test
file (t/*.t) by counting '# TEST' comments.

In order to keep track of the number of tests you need to have a statement
like:

    use Test::More tests => 20

at the beginning of the test file. Then you need to make sure, every test
has a corresponding '# TEST' comment. If you run several tests in a loop,
you can append asterisks plus number to the comment. So for example the 
comment:

    # TEST*3*5

will add 15 tests to the test number.
